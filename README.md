Matoran Fonts
=========

Two Matoran langauge fonts based on images from [BIONICLEsector01](http://biosector01.com/):
<ul>
<li>metrumatoran - The writing system used on Metru Nui and Mata Nui (symbols within circles)</li>
<li>voyamatoran - the writing system used on Voya Nui and Mahri Nui (symbols within hexagons)</li>
</ul>

Both fonts have glyphs for a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and -. Metrumatoran has glyphs for ÅåÄäÖö based on [this image](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110206162731/bionicle/images/9/96/Scandinaviamato.jpg), but they're dubiously canon so I left them out of voyamatoran.

The fonts were created with [Fontello](http://fontello.com/).
